# Python Indentation
# Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

# Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

# Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

# The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.

if 5>1:
    print("yes")

# Python Variables
# In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:

x=5
y='ankit'
z='ankit raj'
print(x, y, z)

# Python Comments

# Comments can be used to explain Python code.
# Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
# Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
# Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.

print("ankit") #ankit
